Ram Hack's First Game Jam
=========================

Welcome to Ram Hack's first ever Game Jam!

A game... what?
---------------
A game jam is an opportunity to work alone or with other students developing a game of your very own.

Wikipedia on Game Jam's:
> A game jam is a gathering of game developers for the purpose of planning, designing, and creating one or more games within a short span of time.

A short amount of time...? I have classes, man...
-------------------------------------------------
Don't worry, I get it. As much as cramming in an entire game in 72 hours sounds, that's not what we're going for here. Our game jam is going to span the course of at least three weeks (final length TBD). We want to encourage people meeting, discussing, and working on the game during meetings. We don't care what it ends up looking like, this is just for fun (and maybe some small prizes).

Sounds cool, but I've never made a game before...
-------------------------------------------------
Me neither! So grab a friend and let's jump in together. We'll discuss some resources during the meeting. Games don't have to be complex and there are tools to make it even easier.

Okay okay, so what's the purpose of the game?
---------------------------------------------
Pick three from this list of words that start with S (or other words that start with S):
* spooky 
* space
* snakes
* super
* skeletons
* snowglobes
* sandwiches
* shame
* sadness
* shame
* S<some characters here>m

What software should I use to make my game?
-------------------------------------------
You can use anything you want! Any language, any engine, anything. Heck, make a text based game if you'd like (that'd actually be awesome).

* [PyGame](http://pygame.org/)
